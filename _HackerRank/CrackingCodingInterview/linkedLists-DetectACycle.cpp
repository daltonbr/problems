This is NOT A STANDALONE TEST
Our hidden code checker passes the appropriate argument to your function.

Detect a cycle in a linked list. Note that the head pointer may be 'NULL' if the list is empty.

A Node is defined as: 
    struct Node {
        int data;
        struct Node* next;
    }
*/

bool has_cycle(Node* head)
{
    // Complete this function
    // Do not write the main method
}
